For the next year, I have been awarded a Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship (ETA) grant in Morocco. To fulfill the grant, I will be living in the city of Meknés and working as an English professor at the Université Moulay Ismaïl in the École Nationale Supériere d'Arts et Métiers, a school for engineering and scientific research. While coursework is completed in French, all of the students are required to develop English proficiency. Meknés is one of Morocco's four historic Imperial cities, having been the capitol of Sultan Moulay Ismaïl in the 17th and 18th centuries. It is located in Northern Central Morocco, near the city of Fes and the Roman ruins of Volubilis. Throughout my time in Morocco, I will be writing here about my experiences teaching and traveling, the history of Meknés and its region, and other relevant insights on language and culture. I hope you find it interesting—مرحب بكم!
